                            The dogs are good friends of humans. They are incredibly important to us. The dogs are not just a pet animal, but they hold much importance in our religious traditions. These traditions are from different religions spread across the whole world.

                            In Hinduism, Dogs is a representative of deity 'Bhirav'. Hinduism worships dogs especially for his honesty, loyalty and the ability of protection. Among the 12 zodiac signs in Chinese tradition, one zodiac sign is the dog. Despite being the best friend of human, Chinese people use them for performing rituals and traditions.
                            
                            Dogs have been the second most important domesticated animal in Egyptian history. In ancient Egyptian culture, it was an important tradition to bury the dog with his master after his death. Even in Zoroastrianism, the dogs are the cleanest, most honest, sacred and the most important animal. They especially feed dogs on the death memorial of someone.

                        <p>Chauncey is a Shitzu- Pomeranian mix, he is currently 2 years old and a cancer. 
                            I’ve had Chauncey since he was just a baby. He likes to chew things, ranging from my hair combs, 
                            random tissues and anything that you had drop and 
                        left on the ground for more than 10 seconds. He is the most lovable dog in the world. 
                        He especially loves other dogs but his enthusiasm scares the dogs and the run away. 
                        Safe to say he doesn’t have any friends except for this brother Marley.</p>
                       
                   
                        <p>Chauncey is very spoilt if you are eating he wants to be eating that too, if you are sitting he wants to be sitting right beside you as well.
                and his favourite spot to sleep is right beside me on the bed.

                        <p>One of the most faithful and helpful animals on the earth is a dog. Dogs consist of four feet for running and jumping. They have two eyes, ears, and one tail, which makes them look beautiful. The stunning look of a dog also consists of one major part that is sharp teeth. Dogs can run very fast. 
                            Thus, they can help you to exercise more. They can eat large amounts of meat, milk, green vegetables, fruits, rice, fish, and many other things. 
                            Yet, all the sweet items are harmful to the health of dogs. Dogs are knowledgeable pets. 
                            Thus, they keep a quick watch on the people at night. 
                            Many military and police workers use trained dogs for catching thieves and criminals.
                             The smelling power of dogs is mighty and strong. Thus, they can sense things from far after they smell them once. 
                             Dogs consist of very friendly and over protecting nature.</p>

                        <p>Marley is a mongrel-Pitbull mix, he is currently 5 years old Scorpio. 
                            I’ve also had Marley since he was a baby. Unlike Chauncey he is our “outside” dog. 
                            He is not friendly what so ever unless you are a member of the family or a very close friend then he’s a sweetheart. 
                            He enjoys stealing toys from Chauncey, running down people and cars in the street and especially loves coming inside the house to sleep. 
                            he loaves water he believes that a bathe is the ultimate form of torture to ever exist </p>
